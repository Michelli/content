##### EWS v2

- Fixed an issue where fetching failed when email attachments had headers with an invalid format (`<[invalid_value]>` instead of `<valid_value>`), by removing the square brackets.
- Fixed an issue where attachments with invalid characters in the From header were not being processed correctly by replacing the invalid characters with a white space character.
