#### Scripts

##### New: MITRENameByID_Formatter

- New: Get a MITRE ATT&CK object name by its ID. The script is using TIMs IOCs to find the correct name (MITRE ATT&CK IOCs must exist in the Threat Intel data).

##### ExtractAttackPattern

- Updated the Attack Pattern formatter to check for the mitre name within TIM and not via an API call.
- Updated the Attack Pattern formatter to also support other MITRE objects.
