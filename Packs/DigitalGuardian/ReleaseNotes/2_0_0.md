##### Digital Guardian

- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.11.10.116949*.

##### Digital Guardian ARC Event Collector

- Updated the Docker image to: *demisto/python3:3.11.10.116949*.

- Revised the event collector logic to utilize the 'Export Profiles Acknowledge v2' endpoint in the Digital Guardian API. This ensures that the internal bookmark within the API is updated to the last exported event, enabling subsequent event fetches to retrieve only new events.
