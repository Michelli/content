# Digital Guardian

This pack integrates with Digital Guardian's Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solution to facilitate incident management and response coordination and protect sensitive data from threats posed by malicious insiders and external adversaries.

## What does this pack do?

* Automates Alert Creation: Automatically creates alerts in Cortex XSIAM from data protection events and alerts fetched from Digital Guardian, enabling a swift response to data threats.

* Response Actions: Allows Cortex to execute response actions within Digital Guardian to mitigate risks without manual intervention.

* Visibility Enhancement: Provides enhanced visibility into security events with a dedicated dashboard in Cortex XSIAM for monitoring Digital Guardian alerts and activities.

* Custom Alert Types and Layouts: Supports custom alert types and layouts tailored to the specifics of Digital Guardian alerts and events, ensuring that the relevant data is presented effectively to security analysts.

Customers can decide which of these alerts are integrated by selecting a Digital Guardian export profile, ensuring visibility is bespoke to your individual SOC’s needs. Alerts and events from the event collector integration will populate in the ‘Alerts’ page.
